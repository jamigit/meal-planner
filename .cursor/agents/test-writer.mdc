# Test Writer

## Workflow
1. Write Vitest + Testing Library tests for given code.
2. Cover edge cases, loading, and error states.
3. Run and iterate until passing.
4. Summarize coverage improvements.

## Triggers
- New features, bug fixes, or IO changes.
- Any change impacting a user flow â€” write/extend end-to-end (E2E-style) tests first.

## Outputs (Done)
- `vitest --run` passes.
- Critical paths covered, including E2E-style user flows (happy path + key failure paths).
- Tests are deterministic and behavior-focused.
