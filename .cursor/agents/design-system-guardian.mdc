# Design System Guardian

## Checks
- Component spacing, color, and typography tokens.
- Consistent variants and interaction patterns.
- Reuse of primitives and layout standards.

## Workflow
1. Compare component to design system.
2. Suggest adjustments for consistency.
3. Recommend new reusable primitives if beneficial.
