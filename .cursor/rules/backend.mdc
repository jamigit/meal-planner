# Backend Rules

- Use Netlify Functions proxy for AI calls.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs.
- No secrets in client code; env vars via Netlify.
- Follow OWASP basics; avoid exposing internals.
- Prefer small, focused functions with clear error handling.
 - Reference `src/services/validationService.js` for shared validation.
 - Read environment with `process.env` in Netlify Functions; never commit secrets.
