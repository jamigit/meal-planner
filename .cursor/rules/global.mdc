# Global Repo Rules

- Be explicit, concise, and technical.
- Ask clarifying questions before guessing.
- Use service layer for all data access.
- Prefer async/await; avoid .then chains.
- Semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, proper labeling.
- Sanitize inputs; avoid unsafe HTML.
- Co-locate tests next to code; test behavior, not implementation.
- Validation gates: eslint, vitest, accessibility sanity checks.
- Import order: React, external, internal (@/), parent, sibling.
- Reference `../instructions.mdc`, `../architecture.mdc`, and repo `patterns.md`.
