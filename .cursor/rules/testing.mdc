# Testing Rules

- Vitest + Testing Library.
- Test behavior, not implementation details.
- Query by role/name/label; avoid test IDs unless necessary.
- Co-locate tests: `<file>.test.jsx|js`.
- Cover critical paths and regressions; keep tests deterministic.
 - Organize fixtures under `src/tests/fixtures` and mocks under `src/tests/mocks`.
 - Minimum critical coverage: routes, services, and regression fixes.
 - In CI or pre-commit, avoid watch mode: `vitest --run`.
