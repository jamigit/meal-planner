### 📦 Recipe URL Import — Delivery Plan

This plan adds a consistent “Paste URL → Scrape → Autofill form” flow.

#### 1) Backend: Scrape API and Hardening
- [ ] Add POST `/api/scrape-recipe` (body: `{ url }`) on Express server
- [ ] Validate URL: http/https only; block private/local IPs; resolve DNS per-request
- [ ] Network controls: 10s timeout, 3 redirects max, 1–2 MB max body, custom User-Agent
- [ ] Rate limiting: 5/min per IP and simple global cap; return 429 on exceed
- [ ] Small in-memory cache (LRU, ~100–500 entries, 15 min TTL) by normalized URL

#### 2) Parsing & Normalization (Server)
- [ ] Extract JSON-LD `schema.org/Recipe` (handle arrays and `@graph`)
- [ ] Fallback: Microdata/RDFa (`itemtype*="schema.org/Recipe"`)
- [ ] Fallback: Readability (`jsdom` + `@mozilla/readability`) + conservative selectors
- [ ] Normalize fields: `name`, `ingredients[]`, `instructions[]`, `prep_time`, `cook_time`, `servings`, `image_url`
- [ ] Convert ISO 8601 durations (e.g., `PT30M`) → minutes; sanitize strings; strip HTML

#### 3) Client: RecipeForm Integration
- [ ] Add URL input and “Scrape” button to `RecipeForm`
- [ ] Show spinner; disable controls during request; support cancel
- [ ] Autofill behavior: fill empty fields by default; optional “Replace existing” toggle
- [ ] Highlight changed fields; show non-blocking toast on success/error

#### 4) Errors, Logging, Observability
- [ ] Structured errors with codes: `INVALID_URL`, `BLOCKED_HOST`, `TIMEOUT`, `FETCH_ERROR`, `PARSING_FAILED`, `NO_RECIPE_FOUND`, `RATE_LIMITED`
- [ ] Structured logs: request id, host, duration, cache hit, parse method, response size
- [ ] Basic metrics counters (success/fail by host, parse path)

#### 5) Testing Matrix
- [ ] Fixture tests across major sites (Allrecipes, BBC, SeriousEats, BonAppetit, Minimalist Baker, Pinch of Yum, etc.)
- [ ] Include at least one non-English site and a JS-heavy page
- [ ] Snapshot normalized outputs for stability

#### 6) Compliance & Ops
- [ ] Decide/document `robots.txt` policy and Terms stance (user-initiated import)
- [ ] Backoff on 403/429; friendly User-Agent; expose `X-Request-ID`

#### 7) Optional (Feature-flagged)
- [ ] Spoonacular “Recipe Extract” fallback behind env flag and API key

## 🚨 Data Structure & Testing Status

### Critical Issues Identified

**Schema Inconsistencies Found:**
- **Missing Field**: `name` column missing from Supabase `weekly_plans` table (data loss)
- **Type Mismatch**: `is_current` uses integers (0/1) in IndexedDB vs booleans in Supabase
- **Naming Convention**: Documentation shows `camelCase` but code uses `snake_case`
- **Array Handling**: Different normalization between storage backends

**Architecture Decision:**
- **Dual Storage**: Keep both IndexedDB (dev/demo) + Supabase (production)
- **Clear Separation**: IndexedDB = offline development, Supabase = authenticated production
- **One-way Migration**: IndexedDB → Supabase only (no going back)

### Testing Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes (Highest Impact)**
1. ✅ **Fix missing `name` field in Supabase weekly_plans table** - Migration script created
2. ✅ **Fix `is_current` boolean type inconsistency** - IndexedDB now uses proper booleans

## 🎯 CRUD App Quality Checklist & Implementation Plan

This section outlines a comprehensive checklist for building production-ready CRUD applications, prioritized by impact and implementation order.

### Priority 1: Critical (App-Breaking if Missing)

#### Error Handling
- [ ] All API calls wrapped in try-catch blocks
- [ ] Consistent error object structure across app: `{ success: boolean, data?: T, error?: Error }`
- [ ] Handle different error types: network, 404, 500, auth, validation
- [ ] Error boundaries for component-level React failures
- [ ] User-friendly error messages (not raw error objects/stack traces)
- [ ] Errors logged, never silently swallowed
- [ ] Error tracking service integrated (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.)

#### Loading States
- [ ] Loading indicator for every async operation
- [ ] Distinguish initial load vs. refresh/update states
- [ ] Skeleton screens for content areas (not just spinners)
- [ ] No blocking UI during background operations
- [ ] Loading states don't prevent reading existing data

#### Data Validation
- [ ] Client-side validation before submission
- [ ] Server-side validation (never trust client)
- [ ] Type safety: TypeScript or PropTypes for all data shapes
- [ ] Schema validation for API responses (Zod, Yup, io-ts)
- [ ] Inline validation errors, not just on submit
- [ ] Prevent invalid form submission (disable button)

#### Request Lifecycle
- [ ] Cancel pending requests on component unmount
- [ ] Abort controllers for fetch/axios cancellation
- [ ] No memory leaks from unresolved promises
- [ ] Request deduplication (don't send identical concurrent requests)
- [ ] Timeout for long-running requests (30s+)

#### Security Basics
- [ ] Input sanitization to prevent XSS
- [ ] CSRF protection for all mutations
- [ ] Auth tokens in httpOnly cookies (not localStorage)
- [ ] Sanitize user-generated content before rendering
- [ ] HTTPS for all API calls
- [ ] Input length limits to prevent DOS
- [ ] File upload validation (type, size) if applicable

### Priority 2: Production-Ready

#### State Management
- [ ] Server state separated from UI state (React Query/SWR/TanStack)
- [ ] Single source of truth for each piece of data
- [ ] No data duplication across state locations
- [ ] State lifted only as high as needed
- [ ] Unidirectional data flow (props down, events up)

#### Data Normalization
- [ ] Nested data normalized to prevent duplication
- [ ] Related entities stored by ID reference
- [ ] Updates propagate correctly to all references

```javascript
// Good structure
{
  posts: { 1: { id: 1, authorId: 5 }, 2: { id: 2, authorId: 5 } },
  users: { 5: { id: 5, name: "Jane" } }
}
```

#### Empty States
- [ ] Explicit empty state UI (not blank screens)
- [ ] Empty states have helpful messaging/actions
- [ ] Distinguish "loading" from "no data" from "error"
- [ ] First-time user empty states guide next steps

#### Optimistic Updates
- [ ] UI updates immediately on user action
- [ ] Rollback on server failure with error notification
- [ ] Subtle sync indicator during server request
- [ ] Handle race conditions with request IDs/timestamps

```javascript
async function deleteItem(id) {
  const original = [...items];
  setItems(items.filter(item => item.id !== id));
  
  try {
    await api.delete(`/items/${id}`);
  } catch (error) {
    setItems(original); // Rollback
    showError('Failed to delete');
  }
}
```

#### Network Resilience
- [ ] Detect offline state and disable actions
- [ ] Clear "offline" indicator shown to user
- [ ] Auto-retry failed requests with exponential backoff
- [ ] Show cached/stale data when offline (with indicator)
- [ ] Handle 429 (rate limit) responses gracefully

#### Concurrency Handling
- [ ] Edit conflicts detected (two users editing same data)
- [ ] ETags or version numbers for optimistic locking
- [ ] Conflict resolution UI shown when detected
- [ ] Clear strategy: last-write-wins vs. merge vs. user choice

```javascript
// Example with ETag
async function updateItem(id, data, etag) {
  const response = await api.put(`/items/${id}`, data, {
    headers: { 'If-Match': etag }
  });
  
  if (response.status === 412) {
    // Conflict detected
    showConflictResolutionUI();
  }
}
```

#### Idempotency
- [ ] Operations safe to retry without duplicate effects
- [ ] POST create checks for duplicates (unique constraint)
- [ ] DELETE returns success even if already deleted
- [ ] PUT/PATCH updates are replayable
- [ ] Unique request IDs for deduplication if needed

#### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for data transformation logic
- [ ] Integration tests for API calls with mocked responses
- [ ] Error scenarios explicitly tested
- [ ] Race conditions and cleanup tested
- [ ] Test coverage >70% for critical paths

#### Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Different log levels: debug, info, warn, error
- [ ] User actions logged for debugging
- [ ] API performance tracked
- [ ] Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- [ ] Structured logging (JSON format)

### Priority 3: Quality User Experience

#### Form Handling
- [ ] Track dirty/pristine state
- [ ] Warn before leaving with unsaved changes
- [ ] Disable submit button during submission
- [ ] Prevent double submission (debounce)
- [ ] Field-level validation (not just form-level)
- [ ] Async validation where needed (username availability)
- [ ] Auto-save drafts (localStorage or server)
- [ ] Clear form after successful submit (or redirect)

#### CRUD Operation Patterns
- [ ] Proper HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE
- [ ] RESTful or consistent endpoint naming
- [ ] Standard response formats across endpoints
- [ ] Proper status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, 500)
- [ ] Cache invalidation after mutations
- [ ] List refreshed after creating new item
- [ ] Detail views updated after edits

#### Batch Operations
- [ ] Select all/deselect all functionality
- [ ] Progress indicators (3 of 10 completed)
- [ ] Handle partial failures (show which items failed)
- [ ] Allow canceling in-progress operations
- [ ] Optimize with single API call when possible

#### URL/Route State
- [ ] Filters and search persisted in URL params
- [ ] Shareable links with current view state
- [ ] Back button restores previous state correctly
- [ ] Deep linking to specific items/views works
- [ ] URL synced with application state

#### Soft Deletes & Undo
- [ ] Important data uses soft delete (deletedAt timestamp)
- [ ] Undo functionality for destructive actions
- [ ] Time-limited undo window (30-60 seconds)
- [ ] Undo notification shown after deletion
- [ ] Permanent delete available for admins

#### Audit Trail
- [ ] Track who created/modified records
- [ ] Timestamp all changes (createdAt, updatedAt)
- [ ] Change log for important data
- [ ] Creator/modifier fields (createdBy, updatedBy)

#### Accessibility
- [ ] All form inputs have associated labels
- [ ] Error messages announced to screen readers (aria-live)
- [ ] Loading states use aria-live regions
- [ ] Full keyboard navigation
- [ ] Focus management (after delete, modal close)
- [ ] Semantic HTML (buttons, forms, headings)
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards

#### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Virtualize long lists (>100 items) with react-window
- [ ] Memoize expensive computations (useMemo, useCallback)
- [ ] Debounce search/filter inputs (300-500ms)
- [ ] Lazy load components and routes
- [ ] Pagination or infinite scroll for large datasets
- [ ] Prefetch on hover for predictive loading
- [ ] Request cancellation for stale searches

#### Data Fetching Patterns
- [ ] Fetch data at component level where needed
- [ ] Response caching to avoid redundant requests
- [ ] Pagination implemented (don't load all data)
- [ ] Stale-while-revalidate pattern for better UX
- [ ] Background refresh for frequently accessed data

### Priority 4: Code Quality & Architecture

#### Code Organization
- [ ] API calls separated from components (/api, /services)
- [ ] Colocate related files (component, styles, tests)
- [ ] Shared utilities in /utils or /lib
- [ ] Types/interfaces in dedicated files
- [ ] Custom hooks extracted for reusable logic

#### Component Patterns
- [ ] Separate presentational from container components
- [ ] Components focused on single responsibility
- [ ] No prop drilling (use composition or Context)
- [ ] Context used sparingly (truly global state only)
- [ ] No inline object/array creation in renders

#### API Client Setup
- [ ] Centralized API client configuration
- [ ] Request/response interceptors for common logic
- [ ] Automatic auth token refresh
- [ ] API versioning strategy
- [ ] Consistent base URL and headers

### Quick Automated Validation

For agentic tool to check:

#### Critical Checks
```javascript
// Pattern matching for common issues
- [ ] console.log/console.error in production code
- [ ] fetch/axios without .catch() or try-catch
- [ ] useEffect with async without cleanup
- [ ] localStorage used for auth tokens
- [ ] Inline styles creating new objects each render
- [ ] Missing loading states on async operations
- [ ] Raw error objects shown to users
- [ ] No key prop in list items
- [ ] Mutations without cache invalidation
```

#### Data Flow Checks
```javascript
- [ ] Server data duplicated in multiple state variables
- [ ] No single source of truth violations
- [ ] Props drilling more than 2 levels deep
- [ ] Context updates causing unnecessary re-renders
```

#### Security Checks
```javascript
- [ ] User input rendered with dangerouslySetInnerHTML
- [ ] API calls over http:// instead of https://
- [ ] Sensitive data in console.log statements
- [ ] Missing input sanitization before display
```

### Implementation Order for New Apps

- **Week 1**: Error handling + Loading states + Basic validation
- **Week 2**: State management + Data fetching + Request cancellation
- **Week 3**: Optimistic updates + Network resilience + Testing
- **Week 4**: Forms + Batch operations + Accessibility
- **Week 5**: Performance + Logging + Polish

### Critical Anti-Patterns to Flag

```javascript
❌ BAD: No error handling
const data = await fetch('/api/items').then(r => r.json());

✅ GOOD: Proper error handling
const result = await fetchItems();
if (!result.success) {
  showError(result.error.message);
  return;
}

❌ BAD: No cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData();
}, []);

✅ GOOD: Cleanup on unmount
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  fetchData(controller.signal);
  return () => controller.abort();
}, []);

❌ BAD: Blocking UI
setLoading(true);
await saveData();
setLoading(false);
// Can't interact with anything

✅ GOOD: Non-blocking
setSaving(true);
await saveData();
setSaving(false);
// Rest of UI still usable

❌ BAD: Nested duplicated data
{ posts: [{ author: {id: 1, name: "Jane"} }] }

✅ GOOD: Normalized
{ posts: {1: {authorId: 1}}, users: {1: {name: "Jane"}} }
```

This checklist is comprehensive but prioritized - start with Priority 1, then work through the rest based on your app's maturity and needs.

## 🏆 Best Practices & Implementation Guidelines

### **Error Handling Best Practices**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Consistent error response structure
const result = await serviceOperation()
if (!result.success) {
  showUserFriendlyError(result.error.message)
  logError(result.error) // For debugging
  return
}
const data = result.data

// ❌ BAD: Inconsistent error handling
try {
  const data = await serviceOperation()
  return data
} catch (error) {
  throw error // Raw error exposed to UI
}
```

**Key Principles:**
- Always wrap async operations in try-catch
- Use consistent error response structure: `{ success, data, error }`
- Provide user-friendly error messages, not raw stack traces
- Log errors for debugging but don't expose sensitive information
- Implement error boundaries for React component failures

### **Loading States Best Practices**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Non-blocking loading states
const { isLoading, startLoading, stopLoading } = useLoadingState()

const handleSave = async () => {
  startLoading('update', 'Saving recipe...')
  try {
    await saveRecipe(data)
    showSuccess('Recipe saved!')
  } catch (error) {
    showError('Failed to save recipe')
  } finally {
    stopLoading()
  }
}

// ❌ BAD: Blocking UI
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
const handleSave = async () => {
  setLoading(true) // Blocks entire UI
  await saveRecipe(data)
  setLoading(false)
}
```

**Key Principles:**
- Distinguish between initial load, refresh, and update states
- Use skeleton loaders for content areas, not just spinners
- Never block the entire UI for background operations
- Provide progress indicators for long-running operations
- Allow users to interact with other parts of the app during loading

### **Data Validation Best Practices**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Comprehensive validation with real-time feedback
const validationSchema = {
  name: {
    required: true,
    minLength: 1,
    maxLength: 200,
    pattern: /^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-'&.,()]+$/,
    message: 'Recipe name must be 1-200 characters'
  },
  prep_time: {
    required: false,
    min: 0,
    max: 1440,
    message: 'Prep time must be between 0 and 1440 minutes'
  }
}

// Real-time validation
const validateField = (fieldName, value) => {
  const rule = validationSchema[fieldName]
  // ... validation logic
  return { isValid, errors }
}
```

**Key Principles:**
- Validate on both client and server side
- Provide real-time feedback as users type
- Use descriptive error messages
- Prevent form submission with invalid data
- Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks

### **Request Lifecycle Best Practices**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Proper cleanup and cancellation
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController()
  
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await api.getData({ signal: controller.signal })
      setData(result)
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.name !== 'AbortError') {
        handleError(error)
      }
    }
  }
  
  fetchData()
  
  return () => controller.abort()
}, [dependency])

// ❌ BAD: No cleanup
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData() // Memory leak if component unmounts
}, [dependency])
```

**Key Principles:**
- Always use AbortController for cancellable requests
- Clean up subscriptions, intervals, and timeouts
- Prevent memory leaks by canceling pending requests
- Implement request deduplication for identical concurrent requests
- Set reasonable timeouts for long-running operations

### **Security Best Practices**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Input sanitization and validation
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify'

const sanitizeInput = (input) => {
  if (typeof input !== 'string') return ''
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(input, { USE_PROFILES: { html: true } })
}

const validatePassword = (password) => {
  const errors = []
  if (password.length < 8) errors.push('Must be at least 8 characters')
  if (!/[A-Z]/.test(password)) errors.push('Must contain uppercase letter')
  if (!/[a-z]/.test(password)) errors.push('Must contain lowercase letter')
  if (!/[0-9]/.test(password)) errors.push('Must contain number')
  return errors
}
```

**Key Principles:**
- Sanitize all user input before rendering
- Validate file uploads (type, size, content)
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Store sensitive data securely (httpOnly cookies, not localStorage)
- Implement rate limiting and account lockout for failed login attempts

### **Performance Best Practices**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Memoization and optimization
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data, onUpdate }) => {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => {
    return data.map(item => expensiveProcessing(item))
  }, [data])
  
  const debouncedUpdate = useCallback(
    debounce(onUpdate, 300),
    [onUpdate]
  )
  
  return <div>{/* render processedData */}</div>
})

// ✅ GOOD: Virtual scrolling for large lists
const VirtualizedList = ({ items }) => {
  const { visibleItems, totalHeight, handleScroll } = useVirtualScrolling(items, {
    itemHeight: 50,
    containerHeight: 400
  })
  
  return (
    <div style={{ height: totalHeight }} onScroll={handleScroll}>
      {visibleItems.map(item => <Item key={item.id} {...item} />)}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Key Principles:**
- Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately
- Implement virtual scrolling for lists with 100+ items
- Debounce user input (search, form validation)
- Lazy load components and routes
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- Monitor performance with real user metrics

### **Accessibility Best Practices**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
const AccessibleButton = ({ onClick, children, disabled, loading }) => {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      disabled={disabled || loading}
      aria-describedby={loading ? 'loading-text' : undefined}
      className="btn btn-primary"
    >
      {loading && <span id="loading-text" className="sr-only">Loading...</span>}
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}

// ✅ GOOD: Keyboard navigation
const handleKeyDown = (event) => {
  switch (event.key) {
    case 'Enter':
    case ' ':
      event.preventDefault()
      handleClick()
      break
    case 'Escape':
      handleClose()
      break
  }
}
```

**Key Principles:**
- Use semantic HTML elements (button, nav, main, section)
- Provide alternative text for images and icons
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- Use ARIA attributes to describe dynamic content
- Maintain proper focus management
- Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation

### **Testing Best Practices**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Comprehensive test coverage
describe('RecipeService', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    await cleanupTestData() // Ensure test isolation
  })
  
  it('should handle validation errors gracefully', async () => {
    const invalidRecipe = { name: '', tags: 'not-an-array' }
    
    const result = await recipeService.add(invalidRecipe)
    
    expect(result.success).toBe(false)
    expect(result.error.message).toContain('validation')
  })
  
  it('should normalize data consistently', async () => {
    const recipe = { name: 'Test', tags: null, prep_time: 0 }
    
    await recipeService.add(recipe)
    const retrieved = await recipeService.getById(recipe.id)
    
    expect(retrieved.tags).toEqual([])
    expect(retrieved.prep_time).toBeNull()
  })
})
```

**Key Principles:**
- Test both happy path and error scenarios
- Ensure test isolation with proper cleanup
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases)
- Test data normalization and validation
- Include integration tests for critical user flows
- Aim for high coverage of business logic, not just lines of code

### **Code Organization Best Practices**

```javascript
// ✅ GOOD: Clear separation of concerns
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/             # Basic UI primitives
│   └── features/       # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── services/           # Business logic and API calls
├── utils/              # Pure utility functions
├── contexts/           # React context providers
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
└── tests/              # Test files and utilities

// ✅ GOOD: Consistent naming conventions
const useRecipeOperations = () => { /* ... */ }
const RecipeService = class { /* ... */ }
const validateRecipe = (recipe) => { /* ... */ }
const RECIPE_CONSTANTS = { /* ... */ }
```

**Key Principles:**
- Separate concerns (UI, business logic, data access)
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Organize files by feature, not by file type
- Use barrel exports for clean imports

**Key Architectural Patterns:**

1. **Service Layer Pattern**: Clean separation between UI and data access
2. **Provider Pattern**: React contexts for global state management
3. **Hook Pattern**: Custom hooks for reusable logic
4. **Utility Pattern**: Pure functions for common operations
5. **Error Boundary Pattern**: Graceful error handling in React
6. **Observer Pattern**: Event-driven updates and notifications

### Current Data Architecture

**Storage Backends:**
- **IndexedDB**: Local storage via Dexie (offline-first, no auth)
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL cloud storage (authenticated, multi-user)

**Service Layer:**
- **Service Selector**: Auto-switches based on auth state
- **Dual Implementations**: Each service has IndexedDB + Supabase versions
- **Data Migration**: Built-in migration from local to cloud

**Schema Evolution:**
- **Version 1-5**: IndexedDB migrations handled via Dexie
- **Current**: Both backends support categorized tags, meal scaling, full recipe data

src/utils/performance.js        # Performance optimizations
```

#### **2. Implement Service Layer Pattern**
```javascript
// Use this pattern for your services:
class YourService {
  async operation(data) {
    try {
      const result = await this.performOperation(data)
      return { success: true, data: result, error: null }
    } catch (error) {
      return { success: false, data: null, error: this.normalizeError(error) }
    }
  }
}
```

#### **3. Add React Hooks**
```javascript
// Copy these hooks for consistent patterns:
src/hooks/useServiceOperations.js  # Service operation hooks
src/hooks/useRequestLifecycle.js   # Request lifecycle hooks
```

#### **4. Implement Error Boundaries**
```javascript
// Wrap your app with error boundaries:
<ErrorBoundary>
  <YourApp />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

#### **5. Add Comprehensive Testing**
```javascript
// Use the testing patterns from:
src/tests/setup.js              # Test configuration
src/tests/fixtures/testData.js   # Test data patterns
src/database/__tests__/          # Service testing examples
```

### **Key Takeaways for Your Projects**

1. **Start with Priority 1**: Implement error handling, loading states, and validation first
2. **Use consistent patterns**: Follow the service layer and hook patterns shown here
3. **Test everything**: Include both unit and integration tests
4. **Plan for scale**: Use the architectural patterns for maintainable code
5. **Security first**: Implement security measures from the beginning
