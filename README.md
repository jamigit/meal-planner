### AI Meal Planning Features

#### Overview
The AI meal planning system analyzes meal history and user preferences to suggest personalized weekly meal plans using Claude API. The system enforces dietary restrictions and balances meal variety based on consumption patterns.

#### Key Features
- **Meal History Tracking**: Separate tracking of planned vs actual meals consumed
- **Pattern Analysis**: 8-week historical analysis for frequency classification
- **Dietary Restrictions**: Enforced gluten-free, no red meat/pork restrictions
- **Smart Balancing**: 2 regular (eaten 3+ times) + 2 less regular (0-2 times) meals
- **User Preferences**: Free-form text input for weekly preferences
- **Multiple Options**: 3 different suggestion sets per request
- **Meal Swapping**: Individual meal replacement within selected sets

#### AI Suggestion Algorithm
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Load all available recipes with tags
   - Analyze last 8 weeks of meal history
   - Collect user preferences for current week

2. **Recipe Classification**:
   - **Regular Meals**: Eaten 3+ times in last 8 weeks
   - **Less Regular Meals**: Eaten 0-2 times in last 8 weeks
   - **Recent Avoidance**: Exclude meals from last 2 weeks

3. **Constraint Application**:
   - **Dietary**: Only gluten-free compatible recipes
   - **Protein**: Fish, chicken, turkey, vegetarian only
   - **Variety**: Avoid recent repetition

4. **Suggestion Generation**:
   - Generate 3 different suggestion sets
   - Each set: 2 regular + 2 less regular meals
   - Include reasoning for each selection
   - Provide overall explanation per set

#### User Experience Flow
```
1. User opens Weekly Planner
2. User adds optional preference notes
3. User clicks "Get AI Suggestions"
4. System analyzes history + generates suggestions
5. User views 3 suggestion sets with explanations
6. User selects preferred set
7. User can swap individual meals if desired
